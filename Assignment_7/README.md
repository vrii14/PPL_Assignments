In this assignment we executed two simple programs of finding nth number in a list and factorial(recursive & non-recursive) 
using Lisp. It is a functional programming language and I learnt some amazing concepts of it like:
1. Lisp is the first language which makes heavy use of heap storage which also helps it run very fast like the recursive factorial
program can calculate the factorial of 1000 in less than a second.
2. Lisp expressions are symbolic expressions.
3. Lisp also uses methods of garbage collection to empty the memory when the particular nodes are not in use and it helps lisp
to run programs efficiently.
4. Lisp consists of only three valid objects atoms, lists and strings.
5. It usually evaluates everything which is inside paranthesis and for not wanting it to evaluate it ' is used before 
the parantheses.
